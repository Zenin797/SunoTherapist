# Security Guidelines for LTM Application

This document outlines important security considerations for the LTM (Long-Term Memory) application.

## Environment Variables

- **Never commit `.env` files with real secrets to version control**
- Use `.env.example` as a template and create your local `.env` file
- Rotate API keys regularly

## API Key Management

- Store all API keys in environment variables, not in code
- Use the dotenv package to load environment variables
- Consider using a secrets management service for production

## Input Validation

- All user input is validated in `LTMSample1.py` through the `validate_user_input` function
- Memory content is validated in `core/memory_manager.py` through the `validate_memory_content` function
- Sanitize all inputs before processing

## External Requests

- External API calls are controlled by the `SECURITY_CONFIG["allow_external_requests"]` setting
- All external requests use timeouts to prevent hanging
- External services are conditionally loaded based on security settings

## Data Protection

- User data is filtered by user_id to prevent data leakage
- Timestamps are added to all stored memories for auditing
- Input length limits prevent memory exhaustion attacks

## Logging

- Sensitive information is masked in logs
- Use `get_secure_config()` for logging configuration values
- Logging levels are configurable via environment variables

## Development Practices

1. **Regular Security Reviews**:
   - Regularly audit code for security vulnerabilities
   - Check for hardcoded secrets
   - Review input validation

2. **Dependency Management**:
   - Keep all dependencies updated
   - Run `pip list --outdated` regularly
   - Consider using a dependency scanning tool

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Catch exceptions at appropriate levels
   - Do not expose detailed errors to users
   - Log errors securely

## Security Contacts

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it to:
* Email: [security@example.com](mailto:security@example.com)
* Do not disclose vulnerabilities publicly without coordination
